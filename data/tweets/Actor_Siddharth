Film: #KaaviyaThalaivan #Jigarthanda

Great AppreciationRT @rameshlaus: @Actor_Siddharth Congratulations! Ur movies #Jigarthanda and #KaaviyaThalaivan have won a combined 9 Awards at #NTFF http:/…And leading newspapers like TOI use such substandard websites as their source. No wonder tabloid journalism is stooping lower by the day!Websites like http://t.co/PTccusEQav are a stain on Telugu culture and pride.I hope measures are taken to boycott such cheap, false sources.I hope to be back with good films in Telugu soon. My absence from Telugu cinema is not intentional. I am planning a film in Telugu soon.I would like to clarify again that I have only the greatest fondness and gratitude to Telugu fans for what they have given me.I dubbed my voice for the telugu version of #Jigarthanda close to 10 months ago. I am very eager for the film to release in telugu.A yellow journalism website called http://t.co/PTccusEQav has accused me of not dubbing for #Jigarthanda in telugu due to lack of interest.It's very easy to say it and hard to do but it's true... Let go of all your hate. It's the best thing you can do for you. Try it now.RT @DhanishV: @Actor_Siddharth watched enakkul oruvan today! It's great to see good movies succeeding!
