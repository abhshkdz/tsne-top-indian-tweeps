It's only effect is that of introspection. #IndiasDaughterThe directors focus on the aftermath ie public outrage/protests/amendment of law speaks volumes of our vibrant democracy. #IndiasDaughterThe filmmakers intent is clear. It is not to defame India but use an event that reverberated around the globe as the basis for her study...Watched #IndiasDaughter last night at the U.S. premiere in NYC. Raises some serious questions about the concept of masculinity..
