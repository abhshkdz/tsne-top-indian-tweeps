Use it well; be successful and happy.The future is in the hands of those who belong to the 21st century with the opportunity to build a better humanity by training the mind.Friends are made on the basis of trust and trust only grows if you are kind to people.It is important to teach young people at school that violence is a fruitless approach to solving problems.It’s clear that the ultimate source of happiness is warm-heartedness.Anger cannot coexist with inner peace, which is the principal characteristic of happiness.When our mind is calm, we’re better able to find peace of mind and live a joyful life.If we have respect and concern for other beings, we’ll be able to create an atmosphere of happiness, harmony and real brotherhoodOne of our best human qualities is intelligence; it enables us to judge what is beneficial and what brings harm.In our daily lives, mindfulness, a more holistic and compassionate attitude helps us keep our peace of mind; it’s good for our health too.Compassion is not just the business of the religious; it is important to know it’s everyone’s business, it is a question of human survival.We need to strike a balance between material and spiritual progress, a balance achieved on the basis of love and compassion.Only tolerance and patience can protect us from the destructive effects of anger and hatred.Everyone can practise non-violence, it only calls for determination. If you succeed, it will open the way to a far more peaceful world.Affection and compassion are indispensable in daily life.Idealistic as it may sound, altruism should be the driving force in business, not just competition and a desire for wealth.True compassion isn’t just an emotional response, it’s a firm commitment founded on reason, which doesn’t change if others behave badly.Determination, courage, self-confidence lead to success, but we should always remain humble, modest and unpretentious.Showing respect for others’ rights and views is not only the source of reconciliation it’s also an aspect of compassion.Tolerance is always important, it helps us overcome difficulties. Without it, small things irritate us and we overreact.Material development only gives us sensory pleasure, but to be lastingly happy we need to develop our minds. We need calm minds.Being aware of a single shortcoming within yourself is far more useful than being aware of a thousand in someone else.The purpose of religion is not building grand temples but cultivating positive human qualities like tolerance, generosity and love.We can develop patience and change our attitudes through steady practice - the human mind has such potential.Concern yourselves more with the needs of others, with the needs of all humanity, and you'll have peace of mind.Compassion suits our physical condition, whereas anger, fear and distrust are harmful to our well-being.True friendship develops not as a result of money or power but on the basis of genuine human affection.If we were to think of other people as our human brothers and sisters, there’d be no room for quarrelling or killing each other.Short clip: HHDL answers a question from a young student on compassion at MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA on Oct 31, 2014 http://t.co/NhEmgwc8sdYou can't buy inner peace or wisdom with money. You have to create them within yourself.Without technology humanity has no future, but we have to be careful that we don’t become so mechanised that we lose our human feelings.To meet this century’s challenges, human beings need a greater sense of universal responsibility.Compassion should be unbiased, based on a recognition that others have a right to happiness, just as you do.Love and kindness are the very basis of society. If we lose these positive emotions, society will face tremendous difficulties.Human rights apply to every country because all human beings share an inherent yearning for freedom, dignity and equality.If you develop care and concern for others, you’ll develop a kind of inner strength in spite of your own difficulties and problems.We need to balance material and spiritual progress, acting with love and compassion can help achieve that balance.I believe that human nature is fundamentally positive and gentle; therefore, a human approach should be non-violent.If we do nothing to restrain our angry, spiteful, and malicious thoughts and emotions, happiness will elude us.Even small acts of compassion bring meaning and purpose to our lives.My number one commitment is to extend awareness that peace of mind depends on our cultivating inner values.Affection, warm-heartedness, that makes us happy; wealth alone can’t do that.The value of compassion and forgiveness is not confined to matters of religion. These are human values that we shouldn’t neglect.Patience as we wait to take action is a kind of compassionate mind. Impatience on the other hand can be a source of failure.A calm mind makes us relaxed, improves our health and makes for happier families and communities.Live Webcasts: HHDL's teaching on Nagarjuna's "Precious Garland" from Dharamsala, India on November 11-13. http://t.co/sAB4RqUUHwAffection, a sense of community and a sense of concern for others are not some kind of luxury.
