Lalit Modi made India out of work.The lesson from washout parliament session isn't that it was BJP's or Congress' fault. It's that we have no common agenda.Economy sluggish. Rupee falling. Reforms stalled.Bills pending. Poll promises unmet.We, however, can't seem to get over Gandhi family jokes.If a full majority government has total washout parliament session can anyone, anyone govern India?

After all, you are always right.#NextBanIdea: Olive Oil (too western, only Indian culture desi ghee allowed); funny TV shows (why laugh?); Cappuccino, pizza (not indian)@karunanundy why didn't u expect to :(. Oh well, glad we agree on something! like points u make on TV.Don't ban porn. Ban men ogling, leering, brushing past, groping, molesting, abusing, humiliating and raping women. Ban non-consent. Not sex.Porn ban is anti-freedom, impractical, not enforceable. Politically not very smart too. avoidable. Let's not manage people's private lives.Children are the future of the republic, but our schools are failing them. #MakingIndiaAwesome Preorder here: http://t.co/Hx5tBtHF8ZRealize it is not just the government's job to make India better.

Can't take it for granted.@Pank333 @RajpalSiddharth thanks darling...they do mistake me for a news channel sometimes!Supporting a political party doesn't mean supporting all their mistakes and giving them blind support.

My take on Sec 377: http://t.co/Th2KedvhGGSection 377 should be scrapped. It is regressive, shameful, stupid and infringement of human rights.Cricket games are fixed. The board is corrupt. But Indians won't stop watching and focus on other sports. Who is to blame?My editor @shinieantony's interesting interview on her new book "The Orphanage for Words." Do check it out: http://t.co/sIBCqgEPK2Banks and ATMs shut down in Greece. Country on brink of default. Lesson on what happens when a government overspends because of politics.If the govt has to insert itself in MBA programs, it should create a new, fresh brand like the IIMs and make it better than the IIMs.Govt works on politics,which never allows a centre of excellence to flourish. Full support to IIM boards who know how to run IIMs better.New IIM bill effectively wants every decision of an IIM to be approved by centre. Will destroy one of the few centres of excellence we have.Govt already diluting IIM brand by opening new ones without same standards.Pray please don't hurt them further by taking away their autonomyRT @EconomicTimes: Chetan Bhagat writes: Why our #politicians need to ditch the favour-swapping culture http://t.co/7XqE3oM7YzFour 30/30 acts coming up on Nach Baliye, right now on @StarPlus Don't miss!@RajivMakhni @StarPlus lol you watch and see.Upen-Karishma dance in real molten chocolate (I tasted it!),Himanshoo-Amruta in a plastic bubble.

Will take them to task tomo: https://t.co/VYkwXRP89IAnything dried for months and is mostly dough is not healthy for you. Pretty obvious, Maggi never was healthy. Lead isn't healthy either.Food Inspectors in India can be bought. But how did a global MNC like #nestleIndia allow this to happen? Will the global CEO please answer?Now will someone from #nestleIndia own up, promise stern steps and apologize? Or will it let the 'blame the brand ambassador' game happen?A collusion of unscrupulous MNCs,ad agencies and food regulators leads to junk being sold as emotional nectar to Indians daily. #NestleIndiaIn times to come #NestleIndia and Maggi crisis will be prime example of worst PR management ever. Smug but stupid MNC execs exposed.Dear #NestleIndia, not owning up fast and letting your brand ambassadors get attacked, you amplified the crisis and it blew up in your face.Maggi banned in Delhi. Can see liquor shops on Gurgaon border stocking it soon. Ek Kingfisher ek maggi dena boss.My take on Indians and food, in light of the Maggi issue. Done a while back, mentions instant noodles as well: http://t.co/mzIlPvQ5tO?Maggi Noodles is now facing the biggest and fastest PR disaster in the social media age.
