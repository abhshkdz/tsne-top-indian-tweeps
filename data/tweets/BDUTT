Was this not hammered out in UFA?Pehle Aap, Pehle Aap gets a brand new meaning with neither India nor Pakistan wanting to talk &amp; neither ready to own the decision to scrap@YusraSAskari noNSA talks as good as off. Pakistan says Sartaj Aziz will travel to India only without pre conditions. Not meeting Hurriyat not an optionBreaking:Pakistan says "not possible" to accept India's advise on cancelling Hurriyat meeting. Will come to India only if "No preconditions"India-Pakistan diplomacy is never easy &amp; is almost always schizophrenic  (across parties in both nations). But *THIS* is a blooming circusWho blinks first in calling off the talks. India wants it to be Pakistan. Unless Sartaj plans to come &amp; then walk out to make statement"Wont take dictation from India; wont be brow beaten"- Pakistan govt officials on NSA talks. How in the world can these talks proceed?The fact that India &amp; Pakistan both hardening stands makes Hurriyat the pretext and not the reason. Neither side seems to want talksIf @MEAIndia new red line is no meeting with Hurriyat before OR after the India-Pak talks, my sense is Sartaj Aziz cannot show up in Delhi@VJBedi @7000 isnt it just stunning. I loved it@YearOfRat well, India asked for the UFA meeting btwBreaking: Pakistan baits India; An official says to us "Wont withdraw invite to Hurriyat to public reception. India cant dictate on Kashmir"Breaking: Pakistan hardens stand:"Our canceling Commonwealth meet signals our position on Kashmir. Indian red lines irrelevant to us"Breaking: Pakistan hardens stand, Pakistan officials say "So called Indian red lines irrelevant; we will not be brow-beaten on Kashmir"Isko Kehte Hain Irony. Pakistan court bans movie on #HafizSaeed - but not the man himself. Cinema is dangerous, terrorism is not, is it?Breaking : a senior pakistani official says plans to meet Hurriyat "intact",unchanged.

Chaos ends up making sidebar main leadFrom @nazir_masoodi : Now, house arrest orders on Hurriyat lifted- shortest house arrest ever ! whats going onFact is original red line govt drew last year around Hurriyat-Pakistan meeting unsustainable. Now caught in tangle of own contradictions@SandipGhose politically in valley - and yes original red line was a mistake.. because it is unsustainable@FanVipin its ritual because its been happening for years, if this is a red line you have drawn an unsustainable one@samappan1 not at all, I meant politically you make them more relevant in the valley. Its a counter productive moveIs this a pre-made India Pakistan joint script- Pakistan invites Hurriyat, India house arrests them or red rags being waved to scrap talks!@vijayinder_vats agreeYes Pakistan's meeting with separatists provocative *IF* you choose to give it importance. House arrest just gives Hurriyat undue importanceSurely India is more confident and secure as a country than to care so much about ritual meetings between separatists &amp; PakistanisIf placing Hurriyat leaders under house arrest is to stop them from meeting Pakistanis, makes heroes out of them, makes India seem paranoid@mrsfunnybones see now you have a genetic excuse, no more excuses to not do TV!RT @htTweets: This image of baby next to mum's C-sec wound will stun you http://t.co/pxCArtQeht http://t.co/unf2nyWwlVRT @abpnewstv: NSA-level talks on despite #Pak invite to Kashmiri separatists http://t.co/2E0cOzop0bBrazen misogyny by Mulayam.
