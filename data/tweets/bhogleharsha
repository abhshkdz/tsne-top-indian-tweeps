And why it was tempting to persist with him. At 7/8 and 5th bowler.Unless of course the selectors are worried about Harbhajan and decide 2 spinners enough. Then need a batsman who can bowl 10 overs. Viiay?The question is: does your 5th bowler bat at no 7 or do you play Saha, Ashwin and Bhajji and play Bhuvaneshwar at 9 and Mishra at 10?When you play 5 bowlers, one will always be underbowled. Clearly the selectors want that 5th bowler to bat. Maybe therefore, BinnyI don't know if you need a 3rd seamer in Asian conditions. So if Stuart Binny has to play, it has to be for Ishant or Aaron.RT @BloodDonorsIn: #Bangalore #Fortishospital O+ ve blood required with good hemo count for a Dengue patient Contact: 7406507724. 16Aug.
