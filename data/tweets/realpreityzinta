So true 😘@CmBInShadysWrld absolutely trueIt's the same story everywhere I guess ..But there is hope cuz I have seen good and badly mannered people everywhere https://t.co/xihAs76UMDYou think so ? https://t.co/TRLPT9t4Sm@jollygood433 your country is different from ours. There is very little education and a lot of poor peopleSo it was a bit rough but I learned my lesson after that. I learned never to have bad manners with anyone ever again. Rich or poor 🙈I had 2eat with our help 4a week &amp; assist them with all the work+ apologize &amp; never behave like that again. After that I never did it againI remember when I was 8,I misbehaved with the help in my house &amp; my dad punished me by not making me eat at the dining table with the family@GanUmaYogi 😘RT @bellinaalice: @realpreityzinta #pzchat http://t.co/iTxr5BuVtMRT @Laura4india: @realpreityzinta Manners are important because they build character,build self-esteem &amp; help create a positive environment…Wah !

Actually everyone burps but it's imp to excuse ur self &amp; not do it everyone's face cuz it's kinda disgusting🙈 bachaao😜Therefore a lot of the upbringing of kids ends up from the maid instead of the parents. They look, they see &amp; they absorb. That's my theoryMaids are not very educated in India &amp; since parents don't have that much time the kids end up spending most of their time with the maids.I think the biggest reason kids are losing their etiquette &amp; manners is because of the growing " maid"culture in India. Maids are not very@kerenexcell it's actually heart breaking 😅RT @akashbajaj60001: @realpreityzinta good manners will open doors that the best education cannot..:-))@SRKDELHICFC now that's a different question altogether....
