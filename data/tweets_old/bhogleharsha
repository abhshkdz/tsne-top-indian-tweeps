Lovely evening yesterday with Standard Chartered Bank and #TheWinningWay. Hope the guests see cricket a bit differently! @BhogleAnitaRT @BhogleAnita: Excellent article about Fourier basics! Digital Music Couldn't Exist Without the Fourier Transform http://t.co/yxxY4EiXrt â€¦Is Harbhajan the best spinner at this IPL? Nehra the best Indian seamer? Did you think you would be saying this? #PepsiIPLExcellent comeback by #MI. Behind on D/L, too many wickets lost but played tough cricket. 2nd half MI looking much betterDelighted to be with Standard Chartered Bank &amp; their clients with #TheWinningWay; to show them cricket in a different light. @BhogleAnitaRT @BloodDonorsIn: #Mumbai  B-ve blood needed at Jaslok Hospital Mumbai.

In all prob #KKR too. And #KingsXI won't. Fear #SRH struggling too. My gut feel, watch out for #MILooking at the way the spinners bowled #KKR will think they have enough. May even do 13-14 overs of spinTo judge @YUVSTRONG12 or Dinesh Karthik by their average or strike rate is the fair way of judging them.To judge @YUVSTRONG12 or Dinesh Karthik on the basis of what they get paid is unfair. They didn't demand it, would have played for lessIrrespective of the quality of the decisions, this is death bowling of the highest class from Ashish Nehra.@paritoshZero as is the haunting phoolon wali ghazal from bazaar sung by another hyderabadi talat aziz https://t.co/ce1yXTXdyM@ptrivedi2186 no, money nothing to do with it. he didn't ask for itthis situation is the reason why dinesh karthik is in the side. has to close the game for #rcb.Bravo @Newbigdog batting too late I fear. #CSK #PepsiIPLRT @BloodDonorsIn: #Chennai O+ve blood Urgent.

Pl call 9885004384@cricketyatin @EtienneDelport came after the world cup which was in 1975. hence, as a cricketing event, biggest post packerBut where do England go from here? Look at composition as starting point. Buttler at 8?If Rashid bowling well would be perfect since he batsIn recent years, "grit" wasn't a word that lent itself easily to a description of the West Indies. Good that it can. For now at least.Wonderful to see the West Indies produce two gritty performances. One to save a test and one to win it.@AltCricket all the more special given that the earlier three, apparently, swung away.Meanwhile Kraigg Brathwaite has played a fabulous on-drive as England use up both their reviews in defending 192.....It doesn't matter whether you support Arsenal or United or City. You look at who produces the results consistently. #MourinhoAh yes, The Special One. Names don't matter. 'Boring' doesn't matter. He's the best in the Premiership. That is what matters! #MourinhoHe might be The Chosen One. He's also the best in the Premiership. #Mourinho #Chelsea@GabbbarSingh @AltCricket yes. next gen didn't follow!Another real quality innings from someone who makes batting look so pleasant. #Rahane #PepsiIPLThe #IPL has had its ups and downs  and threats and highs but after 500 games, remains the biggest event in our game since Packer's WSCRT @kunjal23: Missed #MTHRLEADX TweetChat with @BhogleAnita @bhogleharsha  !! Here's the #Storify : http://t.co/e4djg2Eyg4 @MTHRGlobal@AltCricket They said they would make me a veg platter....salad, hummus, roasted veggies, grilled haloumi.....West Indies need 192 to hand England a rather demoralising loss. But last two innings have been smaller so........@ProfDeano @MitchJohnson398 Seen lot of him. Never looked more off colour.....Look forward to seeing big Gurinder Sandhu play. Bowled well for Sydney Thunder. Met him there,said he was excited about playing with ZaheerIndeed, @AltCricket but as it happens one of my best veg meals came at a steakhouse at Mandela Square in Johannesburg!Still a tough grind but #MumbaiIndians staying alive. Bit like they did last year! #PepsiIPL172 is a middling kind of score for #MI. Always tricky knowing if you have got enough when there are lot of resources under-used #PepsiIPLRT @GolaniKunal: @BloodDonorsIn Mum : Urgent Requirement of B+ blood group at Kokilaben Hospital, Mumbai. Need 10-12 people. Call Rahul @ 9â€¦@legalyurs_vinny @Rajeev_rana not sure of either the "big" or the "celebrity".....@hemantbuch lol!!Experts calling it Mayweather. Loved Pacquiao.Shouldn't the expert commentator be telling us more? Can't keep telling us: don't know how the judges will call it!Shouldn't the networks be scoring the bout for people like us?RT @chinmaybhogle: Pac man needs to be more active. Mayweather running away with this fight. We're already halfway through.RT @chinmaybhogle: After all these years, still getting over the fact that this fight is actually happening.Is that a referee or a pastor?Simple t-shirt for Pacquiao, loads of bling for Mayweather! Think am going Pacquiao!!Don't normally watch boxing but settling down to watch Mayweather-Pacquiao with my personal commentator @chinmaybhogle!Afraid #CSK have produced a terrible anti-climax here......Two teams today have beaten others higher on the table. Shows how open the #PepsiIPL is. Expecting gripping next couple of weeksBowling and batting Negi ahead of Jadeja, a message from the captain?#CSK will do really well to win it from here. In case #SRH win it, the 2nd half of the #PepsiIPL will get really close.192 is a good score anyday but when you are 107 after 10, you are entitled to think you should have got more. #SRHvsCSKBack up bowler gives you 4 overs at 7/over and a wicket. Can't ask for more. Value of Suresh Raina. #CSK PepsiIPLEnjoying reading tweets in the last 5 mins! Win some, lose some!With Sarfaraz and Mandeep today, #RCB could lay claim to being the most dangerous batting side now.@BanterBaman nothing wrong with thatGood to see Mandeep Singh showing another side to him. ðŸ˜ŠSuspect #RCB needed someone who could get 15 off 5 rather than a batsman like Mandeep. Would have sent Sarfaraz given Karthik to follow.Know there was nothing in the pitch but if you are 296 down in the 1st innings, this is how you save it! #BANvsPAKThere are some nice questions on @hotstartweets in today's #FanLogicQuiz. Why don't you take a look to see how good you are?RT @chinmaybhogle: New blog post - #MayweatherPacquiao preview.

In a bad patch, needs reassurance, sent back up to no3 #PepsiIPLRahane has a tendency of playing one big shot early on to get him going. Gets him into trouble. If he gets away, then settles to look classy@c_aashish doing a lot of the winning way currentlyHaving said that, umpiring not exactly out of this world......Excellent from Lendl Simmons. Paddled ball onto pad, got a rough decision, just walked away.Not bad. Our twitter chat on #TheWinningWay, on learnings from sport for managers, with #MTHRLeadX ended up trending at No 4. @BhogleAnita@wvraman true. and that is the test. but can't lose that kind of talent too. some take time to matureFor a player of such huge promise, Sanju Samson is a bit of a worry at the moment. Indian cricket has to look after him carefully.Getting Aaron Finch on the telecast from home (skype?) promises to be a revolution in broadcasting. #PepsiIPLRT @BhogleAnita: We've had fun doing this.
