(7/7)@NayaJivan how can I help?@aregeepee - The star of Kolaveri di!Had a wonderful and refreshing meeting with Dhanush. He has unleashed the power of communicating unconventionally with the masses.The swift and firm action of the Chief Minister is commendable. The heroic actions by the 3 deceased staff members also needs recognition.My sympathies go out to the families of patients and the three staff members that have lost their lives in an attempt to rescuing patients.Doctors and attendants allegedly leaving patients to die unattended in these circumstances is unbelievable and deserves condemnation.Every doctor and staff member should be primarily concerned with the well being of patients with a responsibility for caring treatment.All hospitals' primary mandate should be to save the lives of patients, and should not be driven by making extraordinary profits.The recent events in the hospital in Kolkata, resulting in the deaths of several patients is deplorable and inexcusable.We should provide the motivation and the opportunity for these successful people to make their rightful contribution with due recognition.Many of them want to give back to India their expertise and knowledge. Doctors, scientists and technologists are our greatest ambassadors.I visited the new hospital at UCLA and feel proud to see many young Indian doctors in significant positions.Political differences and vested interests should never be allowed to stand in the way of India's economic progress.It would be a question of national pride for every Indian to rebuild the past glory and reestablish the country's economic leadership.We should never let the extraordinary momentum achieved or the global visibility we had diminish.India's growth rate has dropped to 6.9%. The manufacturing growth dropped to 2.7% -  a two year low!Forces thought they would knock us down but instead they created a city of heroes.We should all find our private space to recall the events of 26/11/2008.As I go home at the end of this momentous week, I will fondly remember all the good wishes and kind sentiments expressed by so many.I look forward to my retirement while I am still active and pursue many interests that I enjoy but have not had time to undertake.I am very pleased and committed to achieve a smooth and seamless transition to my successor. Cyrus is a very good choice for the job.Finding a worthwhile successor has been an important milestone and this milestone was achieved yesterday.I have been with the Tata Group since 1962. The years have been exciting and interesting.Enjoyed meeting the students of UH hotel school. Impressed by their intelligence and great spirit. I wish all of them all the very best.Privileged to meet the vibrant Indian community in Houston. Great entrepreneurs who have made their mark on Houston.Most impressed by Renu Khator, President of University of Houston. Makes all Indians proud.His creativity and innovation has changed the way we live. He will be deeply mourned and greatly missed.Steve Jobs has been one of the greatest icons of the Modern Age. His untimely death is a huge loss to us all.
