Work for India,not for a cult.Where are these nut cases who keep attacking me for bias when I write anti-BJP articles? Hide inside like cockroaches when the lights go on?AAP trolls attacking all in frustration instead of reflecting on what happened. I don't hate them, don't mock them, just pity them. #AAPWarSweet how supporters defending Arvind. but guys,this is how accountability is lost. Yes, accountability, for which AAP was created. #AAPWarGuts: Someone in the AAP office ever saying "Arvind, I don't quite agree with that.." #AAPWarFor the unfortunate generation that doesn't know classic Shaan, &amp; to see what happened in AAP today, watch from 6:00 https://t.co/1T8B0kEE9zWhat AAP did today reminded me of the movie Shaan. Remember when Shakal tossed two chairs into the crocodile pond? #AAPBreakUpNever seen such a brazen display of power and ousting of previous colleagues in such a humiliating manner. #AAPKaSting #AAPWar #WarinAAPPower corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolute.How cool would it be to have a sting where super sweet language YY totally loses it...."bahut ho gaya #%#$*"AAP, the AIB roast edition. #AAPKaStingA loss hurts, and that is why winning feels so good. We won it before, we will win it again. Not our day. Happens. #WeGaveItBack214 in 25. 8.6/over. 4 down. Yeh kahan aa gaye hum? :(How annoying do these upbeat ads in the break look when India is losing wickets! #SemifinalPain. This. Is. Not. Happening. #SemifinalDeep seated Indian sexism of women being distracting objects while men are persevering saints in all the hate against players' girlfriends.It's awful when people lash out on a player's significant other if player didn't play well. Not cool. Be emotional, not unfair. #IndvsAus7 wins in a row is no joke. No need for a land of 1.25bn to fear a country of 0.02bn. Go India Go!

Superb! #NZvSAIs Rahul Gandhi going to come back before April 1? Just asking.So abusing people is no longer illegal. However, it doesn't make it a nice thing to do. Like breaking hearts. Not illegal. Not nice. #Sec66Aeveryone happy #sec66a is gone. who put it there in the first place?SA or NZ? Which one easier to defeat in the final? So that we know who to support today only to defeat them later!SA or NZ? Which one is easier to defeat in the final?Glad to know that I live in a free country. No #Sec66A as SC strikes it down.

Or from that black hole of time waste - dial-in conference calls?Most companies are busy doing useless meetings and managing egos instead of innovating or understanding marketing.Innovation. Marketing. Execution. Buzz creation. Apple aces it all. Very few brands in the world come even slightly close.How does a giant corp like Apple be so nimble get it right so many times? And why does the bumbling competition always plays catch-up.Never wore a watch but I see Apple Watch and suddenly...The PDP BJP alliance looks untenable.

Face it. Fix it.I found #IndiasDaughter far more sensitively done than many angry ugly invasive debates on the same issue that happen on our TV channels.Documentary #IndiasDaughter is extraordinary. Moving, thought provoking.
